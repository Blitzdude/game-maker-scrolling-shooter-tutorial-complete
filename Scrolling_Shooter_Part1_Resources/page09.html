<h2>Summary</h2>

Your game is now finished! Why not test it now and see how it plays? As you will no doubt find, it's simple and not terribly polished, but it's a game, it's fun for a short while, and <i>you</i> made it... So you 
should be pleased with yourself! You should also now know a number of important things about <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> and making games:

<ul>
	<li>Variables are used for many things, like storing values or controlling actions.<br><br>
	<li>Variables can have a global scope or an instance scope.<br><br>
	<li>There are a number of built-in variables to make programming your games easier.<br><br>
	<li>Small rooms can be made to look "infinite" with scrolling backgrounds.<br><br>
	<li>You can use Alarms to control the timing of things.<br><br>
	<li>In collision events, actions marked as "other" will affect the other instance in the collision
</ul>

That's quite a lot for such a simple game, but it's still not quite enough. The game has no score, and your player plane being destroyed on a single hit is rather frustrating. The randomness of the enemy planes is also 
something that quickly becomes boring. However these are all things that can be fixed, and in Part 2 of this tutorial we will cover them as well as the use of views and a few other things to turn this into a <i>real</i> 
game so when you are ready, download the second part and see just how we can turn a mediocre game into a great game!
