<h2>Variable Actions</h2>

There are two important actions to deal with variables directly, which can be found in the <b>Control</b> tab of the Actions list in the Object Properties window.
<br>
<br>

<img src="Set_Variable.png"><b> Set a variable</b>.
<br>
<br>

With this action you can set or change the value of a given variable. This can either be one of the built-in variables or your own variable. To create a new variable you specify the name of the variable and the initial 
value, and to set a built-in variable you give the name of it, and it's new value. When you check the <b>Relative</b> box the given value is <i>added</i> to the current value of the variable (so a positive value 
like "5" will increase the value of the variable and a negative value like "-3" will decrease it). Please note that this can only be done for your own variables if the variable already has been <i>set</i> previously! 
Rather than providing a simple value for the variable you can also give an <i>expression</i>. For example, to double the score you could set the value of the built in variable <tt>score</tt> to be <tt>2 * score</tt>.
<br>
<br>

<img src="Test_Variable.png"><b> Check a variable</b>.
<br>
<br>

With this action you can check what the value of a particular variable is. If the value of the variable is equal to the number given, the question returns <tt>true</tt> and the next action (or block of actions) is 
performed. If it is not equal (ie: returns <tt>false</tt>), the next action (or block of actions) is not performed. You can also indicate that the check should be whether the variable value is smaller than the given 
value or larger than the given value. Note that you are not restricted to using just variables but can check any mathematical <i>expression</i> you like. Later, we will see a number of examples of the use of 
these actions.
<br>
<br>

Before continuing, there is one more thing you need to know about variables... As indicated above there are <b>instance</b> variables that "belong" to an instance and there are <b>global</b> variables which 
belong to no instance, but can be accessed and changed or set by all instances. When you use your own variables these are always <b>instance</b> variables that only exist for the instance in whose actions 
you use them.
<br>
<br>

If you want to use your own global variables you have to prefix their name with the word <tt>global</tt> and a dot. So, for example, you can use a variable <tt>global.bonus</tt> to indicate the 
number of bonus points gathered by the player. Always be careful that you use variable names that do not yet exist and are also different from the names of sprites, sounds, etc. One way to achieve this is to 
always let your variables start with e.g. <b>v_</b>.
