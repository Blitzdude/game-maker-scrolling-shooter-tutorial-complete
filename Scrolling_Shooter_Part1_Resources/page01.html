<h2>Scrolling Shooter - Part 1</h2>

Scrolling shooters are a very popular type of arcade action game, and are also rather easy to create with a package like <i>GameMaker</i>. Therefore this makes them the ideal candidate for a tutorial, and in 
this one we will make such a game and, in the process, you will learn a number of aspects of <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>, in particular the use of <b>variables</b>.
<br>
<br>

In a scrolling shooter the player controls an object, for example a plane, spaceship, or a car, which moves over a scrolling background. Obstacles appear on the background that must be avoided and enemies 
appear that must be shot. Often bonus objects appear that can be picked up for addition benefits too. During the game the number, variety, and strength of the enemies increases making it harder and harder 
to survive.
<br>
<br>

In this tutorial we will create a scrolling shooter called <i>1945</i>, in which the player flies in a plane over a sea and enemy planes try to destroy the player. We will treat aspects like how to create the 
illusion of motion using a scrolling background, how to control the plane, how to make enemies and bullets, and how to deal with the score, with lives and with the damage of the plane. But first of all we 
will delve into a very important aspect of <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> that extends the possibilities considerably: the use of <b>variables</b>.

At various points in this tutorial you will be directed towards the "<b>Scrolling Shooter Assets</b>" folder. It can be found in <a href="Scrolling_Shooter_Assets/" target="_BLANK">this folder</a> and 
you should have it open and ready as we will need a few things from it for our game.
